## @Todo

- Improve on styling and overall UI feel
- React-sortable-hoc is deprecated in new versions of react. I works fine now but might cause issues in the future. Currently looking into React-DND-kit as a replacement.
- Add functionality to delete task
- Add functionality to switch `allow_duplicates` setting
